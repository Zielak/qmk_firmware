# Zielak HOMEROW MODS keymap for Redox Wireless

-   home row modifiers (under layers on each side)
-   revamped navigation layer
-   enter back on inner edges
-   window swapper key
-   delete to the right of ALTGR (for symmetry with backspace)

## What bothers me

-   both `-` are far away
-   ~~accidental backspaces~~
-   ~~arrows~~

## TODO

-   `-` and `=` closer to the fingers, maybe in place of keys under `X` and `C`?
-   One handed layers. Can't one handedly press arrows or numbers on neither of boards.
-   dedicated screenshot buttons (in place of arrows?)
